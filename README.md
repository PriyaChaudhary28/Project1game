The Blackjack Game is a console-based (or GUI-based, depending on the interface) application developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It simulates the classic card game of blackjack, where a player competes against an AI-controlled dealer. The game is implemented in Java/Python/JavaScript.
